Treatment is focused on therapy and counseling, rather than prescribing medications for a “quick fix.”

Company Type: Usage Based

Analysis - Stock Simulator 

There are many tools for non-developer points. 
USP - current solutions have only basic stuff capability, not flexible for processing.
Idea - Initial to create interaction.( create dashboard and excel ) by providing historical data.
Future plans - Later we provide a developer sandbox. There is no current sandbox for simulation of strategy. After having users and sandbox we can create a bridge between our sandbox and broker.
Revenue -  Charge small fees who will take our route to do trading.
 

































 
Analysis - Truck Booking
Study points
Total Addressable Market
Revenue model
Entry barrier
Company category
USP (Unique Selling Proposition )
Competitive companies
Requirements - Software/Hardware


Brief overview of idea
In a current scenario 	Most of the trucks get booking from brokers who can take a huge amount of charges. Also many trucks are not getting a proper booking and value of their service , also many times customers also do not get trucks when they need to.
so In this Idea I want to make a central platform like uber/ola web-app where truck drivers get proper booking and also customers get trucks on time. 

USP (Unique Selling Proposition)
Till now there is no platform is built which can directly deal with truck owner and customer or factories warehouses,
In this idea we make a network of different factories and warehouses and connect them directly with truck owners and make a system in such a way that when someone moves from one city to another city they immediately get a different booking.
Also the same thing is with customers/users they choose a truck according to their need and place their booking very easily from our website/app.
By these idea both factories and truck owner get benefits as we know that in factories they production is running 24X7 and every factories needs truck very quickly so that there goods can transfer to different cities,
Also many truck owners need quick booking when they are in different cities. 

Company Type: Service providing company.

Requirement - website or mobile app, a big network of factories and truck owners.





Competitive companies - 
1 - https://truckguru.co.in/ -- this company deals with the gap between user and transporter (Broker).






2 - https://www.trukky.com/ -- this website tries to make a connection between user and truck owner ,but the main problem in this website is that it gives his service in major tier-1 cities only.

3-https://trucksuvidha.com/ -- this website provides the same service which we are planning to do.

4-Rivigo -- this website has its own warehouse and it takes goods from factories and directly transfers them to different cities through a registered truck.


Entry barrier : 
1- Less awareness of using technologies by truck drivers.
2- Many times brokers stop trucks from entering factories as they need commission for every entry.
3- making a strong network with factories and warehouses.

Revenue model:
1- subscription for truck owners .

2- taking service charges from the warehouse or customers.

3- taking charges per ride/booking.


Problem
1.inreaching network.




































Rule:

Do’s
1 - Never call our service as psychiatrist.
